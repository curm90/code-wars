# Code Problems Solutions

A collection of my solutions to coding challenges from Codewars.

## Platform

- **Codewars** - Algorithm and data structure challenges with kyu-based difficulty ratings

## Languages

- **JavaScript** (primary) - Most solutions are implemented in JS
- **Python** - Occasional solutions for data science and algorithm problems
- **Rust** - Learning and practicing systems programming concepts

## Structure

Solutions are organized by:

- Language (`js/`, `python/`, `rust/`)
- Difficulty level (8-kyu, 7-kyu, 6-kyu, 5-kyu based on Codewars rating system)
- Year and month of completion

## Purpose

This repository serves as:

- A personal archive of problem-solving approaches
- Practice for different programming languages
- Reference for algorithm implementations
- Progress tracking over time

Feel free to browse the solutions and see different approaches to Codewars challenges!
